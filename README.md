A text editor with no visual output whatsoever. A text-to-speech engine reads
edits aloud, and an auditory bell provides navigational feedback.

Usage resembles TextEdit with VoiceOver enabled on OS X. This, however, is
implemented in just a couple hundred lines of Python; plus, it's
cross-platform, thanks to the [pyttsx](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyttsx)
and [pyfluidsynth](http://code.google.com/p/pyfluidsynth/) libraries.

Pre-alpha stability. BSD licensed.
